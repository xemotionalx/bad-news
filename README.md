i've got bad news but don't blame me: i scraped it

## Overview
This app scrapes the "The Slot" section of Jezebel's website for recent articles related to American politics. Yes, they're mostly depressing but don't shoot the messenger! I use cheerio to scrape the website for news headlines, links and summaries. The user can then leave comments on the articles, which are saved to Mongo DB. The user can view comments which had previously been left and can can also delete comments.

## Try it Out!
This app will be deployed on heroku.
